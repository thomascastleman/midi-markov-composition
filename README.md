# midi-markov-composition

This interactive music composition algorithm was a project I worked on during an interdisciplinary course in the fall of 2017. It uses [Processing](https://processing.org/) with a [library for MIDI instruments](https://github.com/sparks/themidibus) to serialize live MIDI input into a format that is general enough to train a markov chain on, and generate new music.
